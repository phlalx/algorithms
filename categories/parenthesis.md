# Parenthesis problems

* check if an expression is well-parenthesised (stack, counting) (See !678 for a variant)
* count number of parenthesis -> see [counting](./counting.md)
* generate well-parenthesis expressions -> see [generation](./generation.md)
* longest valid parenthesis (O(n) dp, longest sequence ending in i, a bit tricky)
* minimum remove parenthesis to make an expression valid (bfs !301, greedy !1249)
* minimum added parenthesis to make an expression valid (greedy)

TODO: some solutions may be improved
