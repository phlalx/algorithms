# Selected problems

[1] Two Sum Easy
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they
add up to a specific target. You may assume that each input would have
exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

[4] Median of Two Sorted Arrays Hard
There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.
Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity
should be O(log (m+n)). You may assume nums1 and nums2 cannot be both empty.

nums1 = [1, 3] nums2 = [2]. The median is 2.0
nums1 = [1, 2] nums2 = [3, 4]. The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5

[7] Reverse Integer Easy

[10] Regular Expression Matching Hard
Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement regular expression
matching with support for '.' and '*'. '.' Matches any single character.'*'
Matches zero or more of the preceding element. The matching should cover the
entire input string (not partial). s could be empty and contains only
lowercase letters a-z. p could be empty and contains only lowercase letters
a-z, and characters like . or *.

Input: s = "aa" p = "a" Output: false Explanation: "a" does not match the
entire string "aa".
Input: s = "aa" p = "a*" Output: true Explanation: '*' means zero or more of
the precedeng element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes
"aa".
Input: s = "ab" p = ".*" Output: true Explanation: ".*" means "zero or more
(*) of any character (.)".
Input: s = "aab" p = "c*a*b" Output: true Explanation: c can be repeated 0
times, a can be repeated 1 time. Therefore it matches "aab".

[25] Reverse Nodes in k-Group Hard
Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and
return its modified list.

k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked
list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes in
the end should remain as it is.

Given this linked list: 1->2->3->4->5
For k = 2, you should return: 2->1->4->3->5
For k = 3, you should return: 3->2->1->4->5

[26] Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array Easy

matching with support for '?' and '*'.
'?' Matches any single character. '*' Matches any sequence of characters
(including the empty sequence).
Input: s = "aa" p = "a" Output: false Explanation: "a" does not match the
entire string "aa".
Input: s = "aa" p = "*" Output: true Explanation: '*' matches any sequence.
Input: s = "cb" p = "?a" Output: false Explanation: '?' matches 'c', but the
second letter is 'a', which does not match 'b'.

[1,2,3,4,8,12,11,10,9,5,6,7]

[56] Merge Intervals Medium
Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.
Input: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]] Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].

[57] Insert Interval Hard
Given a set of non-overlapping intervals, insert a new interval into the
intervals (merge if necessary).

You may assume that the intervals were initially sorted according to their
start times.
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5] Output: [[1,5],[6,9]]
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]
Output: [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]] Explanation: Because the new interval [4,8]

one to the integer.

[67] Add Binary Easy
Given two binary strings, return their sum (also a binary string).

[68] Text Justification Hard
Given an array of words and a width maxWidth, format the text such that each
line has exactly maxWidth characters and is fully (left and right) justified.
You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words
as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each
line has exactly maxWidth characters. Extra spaces between words should be
distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line do not
divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned
more spaces than the slots on the right. For the last line of text, it should
be left justified and no extra space is inserted between words.

Input: words = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text",
"justification."] maxWidth = 16 Output: [ "This is an", "example of text",
"justification. " ]

Input: words = ["What","must","be","acknowledgment","shall","be"] maxWidth =
16 Output: [ "What must be", "acknowledgment ", "shall be " ] Explanation:
Note that the last line is "shall be " instead of "shall be", because the
last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified. Note that the
second line is also left-justified becase it contains only one word.

[69] Sqrt(x) Easy

Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be a
non-negative integer. Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits
are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

[71] Simplify Path Medium
Given an absolute path for a file (Unix-style), simplify it. Or in other
words, convert it to the canonical path.

Input: "/home/" Output: "/home" Explanation: Note that there is no trailing
slash after the last directory name.
Input: "/../" Output: "/" Explanation: Going one level up from the root
directory is a no-op, as the root level is the highest level you can go.
Input: "/home//foo/" Output: "/home/foo" Explanation: In the canonical path,
multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.

[74] Search a 2D Matrix Medium
Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix.
This matrix has the following properties: Integers in each row are sorted
from left to right. The first integer of each row is greater than the last

Input: matrix = [ [1, 3, 5, 7], [10, 11, 16, 20], [23, 30, 34, 50] ] target =
3 Output: true
Input: matrix = [ [1, 3, 5, 7], [10, 11, 16, 20], [23, 30, 34, 50] ] target =
13 Output: false

[75] Sort Colors Medium
Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them in-place
so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order
red, white and blue. Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent
the color red, white, and blue respectively. Note: You are not suppose to use
the library's sort function for this problem.

Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0] Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting
sort. First, iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then
overwrite array with total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's. Could
you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant space?

Input: nums = [1,2,3] Output: [ [3], [1], [2], [1,2,3], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2],
[] ]

[79] Word Search Medium
Given a 2D board and a word, find if the word exists in the grid.

[117] Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II Medium
Given a binary tree Populate each next pointer to point to its next right
node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.
Recursive approach is fine, implicit stack space does not count as extra
space for this problem.

value (will always be positive) of the key if the key exists in the cache,
otherwise return -1. put(key, value) - Set or insert the value if the key is
not already present. When the cache reached its capacity, it should

smallest number in the BST. next() and hasNext() should run in average O(1)
time and uses O(h) memory, where h is the height of the tree. You may assume
that next() call will always be valid, that is, there will be at least a next
smallest number in the BST when next() is called.

courses you should take to finish all courses. There may be multiple correct
orders, you just need to return one of them. If it is impossible to finish
all courses, return an empty array. Note: The input prerequisites is a graph
represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices.

[211] Add and Search Word - Data structure design - Medium

void addWord(word) bool search(word)
search(word) can search a literal word or a regular expression string
containing only letters a-z or .. A . means it can represent any one letter.

[212] Word Search II Hard

largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

[218] The Skyline Problem Hard
A city's skyline is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the
buildings in that city when viewed from a distance. Now suppose you are given
the locations and height of all the buildings as shown on a cityscape photo
(Figure A), write a program to output the skyline formed by these buildings
collectively (Figure B).

The geometric information of each building is represented by a triplet of
integers [Li, Ri, Hi], where Li and Ri are the x coordinates of the left and
right edge of the ith building, respectively, and Hi is its height. It is
guaranteed that 0 ≤ Li, Ri ≤ INT_MAX, 0 < Hi ≤ INT_MAX, and Ri - Li > 0. You
may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely
flat surface at height 0.

For instance, the dimensions of all buildings in Figure A are recorded as: [
[2 9 10], [3 7 15], [5 12 12], [15 20 10], [19 24 8] ] .

The output is a list of "key points" (red dots in Figure B) in the format of
[ [x1,y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], ... ] that uniquely defines a skyline. A key
point is the left endpoint of a horizontal line segment. Note that the last
key point, where the rightmost building ends, is merely used to mark the
termination of the skyline, and always has zero height. Also, the ground in
between any two adjacent buildings should be considered part of the skyline
contour.
For instance, the skyline in Figure B should be represented as:[ [2 10], [3
15], [7 12], [12 0], [15 10], [20 8], [24, 0] ].

The number of buildings in any input list is guaranteed to be in the range
[0, 10000]. The input list is already sorted in ascending order by the left x
position Li. The output list must be sorted by the x position. There must be
no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For
instance, [...[2 3], [4 5], [7 5], [11 5], [12 7]...] is not acceptable; the
three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as
such: [...[2 3], [4 5], [12 7], ...]

[230] Kth Smallest Element in a BST Medium
Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth
smallest element in it.

Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3 5 / \ 3 6 / \ 2 4 / 1 Output: 3
Follow up: What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and
you need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the
kthSmallest routine?

that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except
nums[i].
Input: [1,2,3,4] Output: [24,12,8,6]

Follow up: Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output
array does not count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity
analysis.)

[239] Sliding Window Maximum Hard
Given an array nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from
the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers
in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.
Return the max sliding window.
Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], and k = 3 Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7]

essentially peek() at the element that will be returned by the next call to
next().

[289] Game of Life Medium
Given a board with m by n cells, each cell has an
initial state live (1) or dead (0). Each cell interacts with its eight
neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules
Any live cell with fewer than two
live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population. Any live cell with two
or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation. Any live cell with
more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.. Any dead cell
with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the board
given its current state. The next state is created by applying the above
rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and
deaths occur simultaneously. In-place. Infinite board.

[295] Find Median from Data Stream Hard
Median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the
list is even, there is no middle value. So the median is the mean of the two
middle value. For example,
Design a data structure that supports the following two operations:
void addNum(int num) - Add a integer number from the data stream to the data
structure. double findMedian() - Return the median of all elements so far.
If all integer numbers from the stream are between 0 and 100, how would you
optimize it? If 99% of all integer numbers from the stream are between 0 and
100, how would you optimize it?

[297] Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree Hard
Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a
sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or
transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the
same or another computer environment.
Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no
restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work.
You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and
this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

[310] Minimum Height Trees Medium
For an undirected graph with tree characteristics, we can choose any node as
the root. The result graph is then a rooted tree. Among all possible rooted
trees, those with minimum height are called minimum height trees (MHTs).
Given such a graph, write a function to find all the MHTs and return a list
of their root labels. Format The graph contains n nodes which are labeled
from 0 to n - 1. You will be given the number n and a list of undirected
edges (each edge is a pair of labels). You can assume that no duplicate edges
will appear in edges. Since all edges are undirected, [0, 1] is the same as
[1, 0] and thus will not appear together in edges.

[312] Burst Balloons Hard
Given n balloons, indexed from 0 to n-1. Each balloon is painted with a
number on it represented by array nums. You are asked to burst all the
balloons. If the you burst balloon i you will get nums[left] * nums[i] *
nums[right] coins. Here left and right are adjacent indices of i. After the
burst, the left and right then becomes adjacent.
Find the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely.
You may imagine nums[-1] = nums[n] = 1. They are not real therefore you can
not burst them. 0 ≤ n ≤ 500, 0 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 100

[315] Count of Smaller Numbers After Self Hard
You are given an integer array nums and you have to return a new counts
array. The counts array has the property where counts[i] is the number of
smaller elements to the right of nums[i].

smaller elements (2 and 1). To the right of 2 there is only 1 smaller element
(1). To the right of 6 there is 1 smaller element (1). To the right of 1
there is 0 smaller element.

[330] Patching Array Hard
Given a sorted positive integer array nums and an integer n, add/patch
elements to the array such that any number in range [1, n] inclusive can be
formed by the sum of some elements in the array. Return the minimum number of
patches required.

[331] Verify Preorder Serialization of a Binary Tree Medium
One way to serialize a binary tree is to use pre-order traversal. When we
encounter a non-null node, we record the node's value. If it is a null node,
we record using a sentinel value such as #.
_9_ / \ 3 2 / \ / \ 4 1 # 6 / \ / \ / \
# # # # # #
For example, the above binary tree can be serialized to the string
"9,3,4,#,#,1,#,#,2,#,6,#,#", where # represents a null node. Given a string
of comma separated values, verify whether it is a correct preorder traversal
serialization of a binary tree. Find an algorithm without reconstructing the
tree. Each comma separated value in the string must be either an integer or a
character '#' representing null pointer. You may assume that the input format
is always valid, for example it could never contain two consecutive commas
such as "1,,3".

repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by
next should be: [1,1,2,1,1].

rectangle in the matrix such that its sum is no larger than k.

Input: matrix = [[1,0,1],[0,-2,3]], k = 2 Output: 2 Explanation: Because the
sum of rectangle [[0, 1], [-2, 3]] is 2, and 2 is the max number no larger
than k (k = 2).

The rectangle inside the matrix must have an area > 0. What if the number of
rows is much larger than the number of columns?

top-right point is (2, 2)).

[393] UTF-8 Validation Medium
A character in UTF8 can be from 1 to 4 bytes long, subjected to the following
rules:
For 1-byte character, the first bit is a 0, followed by its unicode code. For
n-bytes character, the first n-bits are all one's, the n+1 bit is 0, followed
by n-1 bytes with most significant 2 bits being 10.
This is how the UTF-8 encoding would work:
Char. number range | UTF-8 octet sequence (hexadecimal) | (binary)
--------------------+---------------------------------------------
0000 0000-0000 007F | 0xxxxxxx 0000 0080-0000 07FF | 110xxxxx 10xxxxxx 0000
0800-0000 FFFF | 1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 0001 0000-0010 FFFF | 11110xxx
10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
Given an array of integers representing the data, return whether it is a
valid utf-8 encoding.
Note: The input is an array of integers. Only the least significant 8 bits of
each integer is used to store the data. This means each integer represents
only 1 byte of data.

[394] Decode String Medium
Given an encoded string, return it's decoded string. The encoding rule is:
k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is
being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive
integer. You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white
spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc. Furthermore, you may assume
that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only
for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there won't be input like 3a or
2[4].

s = "3[a]2[bc]", return "aaabcbc". s = "3[a2[c]]", return "accaccacc". s =
"2[abc]3[cd]ef", return "abcabccdcdcdef".

Given an array of integers with possible duplicates, randomly output the
index of a given target number. You can assume that the given target number

Equations are given in the format A / B = k, where A and B are variables
represented as strings, and k is a real number (floating point number). Given
some queries, return the answers. If the answer does not exist, return -1.0.
Example: Given a / b = 2.0, b / c = 3.0. queries are: a / c = ?, b / a = ?, a
/ e = ?, a / a = ?, x / x = ? . return [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0 ].
The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will
result in no division by zero and there is no contradiction.

9, 10, 11, ... Note: n is positive and will fit within the range of a 32-bit
signed integer (n < 231).

[401] Binary Watch Easy
A binary watch has 4 LEDs on the top which represent the hours (0-11), and
the 6 LEDs on the bottom represent the minutes (0-59). Each LED represents a
zero or one, with the least significant bit on the right. For example, the
above binary watch reads "3:25". Given a non-negative integer n which
represents the number of LEDs that are currently on, return all possible
times the watch could represent.

Example: Input: n = 1Return: ["1:00", "2:00", "4:00", "8:00", "0:01", "0:02",
"0:04", "0:08", "0:16", "0:32"]

The order of output does not matter. The hour must not contain a leading
zero, for example "01:00" is not valid, it should be "1:00". The minute must
be consist of two digits and may contain a leading zero, for example "10:2"
is not valid, it should be "10:02".

middle value. Examples: [2,3,4] , the median is 3 [2,3], the median is (2 +
3) / 2 = 2.5 Given an array nums, there is a sliding window of size k which
is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see
the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one
position. Your job is to output the median array for each window in the
original array. Note: You may assume k is always valid, ie: k is always
smaller than input array's size for non-empty array.

[482] License Key Formatting Easy
You are given a license key represented as a string S which consists only
alphanumeric character and dashes. The string is separated into N+1 groups by
N dashes. Given a number K, we would want to reformat the strings such that
each group contains exactly K characters, except for the first group which
could be shorter than K, but still must contain at least one character.
Furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two groups and all
lowercase letters should be converted to uppercase. Given a non-empty string
S and a number K, format the string according to the rules described above.

Input: S = "5F3Z-2e-9-w", K = 4 Output: "5F3Z-2E9W"

Explanation: The string S has been split into two parts, each part has 4
characters. Note that the two extra dashes are not needed and can be removed.

[483] Smallest Good Base Hard
For an integer n, we call k>=2 a good base of n, if all digits of n base k
are 1. Now given a string representing n, you should return the smallest good
base of n in string format.

Input: "13" Output: "3" Explanation: 13 base 3 is 111.

[485] Max Consecutive Ones Easy
Given a binary array, find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in this
array.

Input: [1,1,0,1,1,1] Output: 3

[486] Predict the Winner Medium
Given an array of scores that are non-negative integers. Player 1 picks one
of the numbers from either end of the array followed by the player 2 and then
player 1 and so on. Each time a player picks a number, that number will not
be available for the next player. This continues until all the scores have
been chosen. The player with the maximum score wins.
Given an array of scores, predict whether player 1 is the winner. You can
assume each player plays to maximize his score.

Input: [1, 5, 2] Output: False Explanation: Initially, player 1 can choose
between 1 and 2. If he chooses 2 (or 1), then player 2 can choose from 1 (or
2) and 5. If player 2 chooses 5, then player 1 will be left with 1 (or 2).
So, final score of player 1 is 1 + 2 = 3, and player 2 is 5. Hence, player 1
will never be the winner and you need to return False.

[493] Reverse Pairs Hard
Given an array nums, we call (i, j) an important reverse pair if i < j and
nums[i] > 2*nums[j]. You need to return the number of important reverse pairs
in the given array.

Input: [1,3,2,3,1] Output: 2
Input: [2,4,3,5,1] Output: 3

The length of the given array will not exceed 50,000. All the numbers in the
input array are in the range of 32-bit integer.

[494] Target Sum Medium
You are given a list of non-negative integers, a1, a2, ..., an, and a target,
S. Now you have 2 symbols + and -. For each integer, you should choose one
from + and - as its new symbol. Find out how many ways to assign symbols to
make sum of integers equal to target S.

the matrix in diagonal order as shown in the below image.

Input: [ [ 1, 2, 3 ], [ 4, 5, 6 ], [ 7, 8, 9 ] ] Output: [1,2,4,7,5,3,6,8,9]

[501] Find Mode in Binary Search Tree Easy
Given a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, find all the mode(s) (the
most frequently occurred element) in the given BST. Assume a BST is defined
as follows: The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less
than or equal to the node's key. The right subtree of a node contains only
nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key. Both the left and
right subtrees must also be binary search trees. 1 \ 2 / 2 return [2]. Note:
If a tree has more than one mode, you can return them in any order. Follow
up: Could you do that without using any extra space? (Assume that the
implicit stack space incurred due to recursion does not count).

[503] Next Greater Element II Medium
Given a circular array (the next element of the last element is the first
element of the array), print the Next Greater Number for every element. The
Next Greater Number of a number x is the first greater number to its
traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly
to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, output -1 for this
number.

Input: [1,2,1] Output: [2,-1,2] Explanation: The first 1's next greater
number is 2; The number 2 can't find next greater number; The second 1's next
greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.

[506] Relative Ranks Easy
Given scores of N athletes, find their relative ranks and the people with the
top three highest scores, who will be awarded medals: "Gold Medal", "Silver
Medal" and "Bronze Medal".

Input: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] Output: ["Gold Medal", "Silver Medal", "Bronze Medal",
"4", "5"] Explanation: The first three athletes got the top three highest
scores, so they got "Gold Medal", "Silver Medal" and "Bronze Medal". For the
left two athletes, you just need to output their relative ranks according to
their scores.

[514] Freedom Trail Hard
In the video game Fallout 4, the quest "Road to Freedom" requires players to
reach a metal dial called the "Freedom Trail Ring", and use the dial to spell
a specific keyword in order to open the door. Given a string ring, which
represents the code engraved on the outer ring and another string key, which
represents the keyword needs to be spelled. You need to find the minimum
number of steps in order to spell all the characters in the keyword.
Initially, the first character of the ring is aligned at 12:00 direction. You
need to spell all the characters in the string key one by one by rotating the
ring clockwise or anticlockwise to make each character of the string key
aligned at 12:00 direction and then by pressing the center button. At the
stage of rotating the ring to spell the key character key[i]: You can rotate
the ring clockwise or anticlockwise one place, which counts as 1 step. The
final purpose of the rotation is to align one of the string ring's characters
at the 12:00 direction, where this character must equal to the character
key[i]. If the character key[i] has been aligned at the 12:00 direction, you
need to press the center button to spell, which also counts as 1 step. After
the pressing, you could begin to spell the next character in the key (next
stage), otherwise, you've finished all the spelling.
Input: ring = "godding", key = "gd" Output: 4 Explanation: For the first key
character 'g', since it is already in place, we just need 1 step to spell
this character. For the second key character 'd', we need to rotate the ring
"godding" anticlockwise by two steps to make it become "ddinggo". Also, we
need 1 more step for spelling. So the final output is 4.
Length of both ring and key will be in range 1 to 100. There are only
lowercase letters in both strings and might be some duplcate characters in
both strings. It's guaranteed that string key could always be spelled by
rotating the string ring.

[520] Detect Capital Easy
Given a word, you need to judge whether the usage of capitals in it is right
or not. We define the usage of capitals in a word to be right when one of the
following cases holds: All letters in this word are capitals, like "USA". All
letters in this word are not capitals, like "leetcode". Only the first letter
in this word is capital if it has more than one letter, like "Google".
Otherwise, we define that this word doesn't use capitals in a right way.

[521] Longest Uncommon Subsequence I Easy
Given a group of two strings, you need to find the longest uncommon
subsequence of this group of two strings. The longest uncommon subsequence is
defined as the longest subsequence of one of these strings and this
subsequence should not be any subsequence of the other strings. A subsequence
is a sequence that can be derived from one sequence by deleting some
characters without changing the order of the remaining elements. Trivially,
any string is a subsequence of itself and an empty string is a subsequence of
any string. The input will be two strings, and the output needs to be the
length of the longest uncommon subsequence. If the longest uncommon
subsequence doesn't exist, return -1.

[523] Continuous Subarray Sum Medium
Given a list of non-negative numbers and a target integer k, write a function
to check if the array has a continuous subarray of size at least 2 that sums
up to the multiple of k, that is, sums up to n*k where n is also an integer.

Input: [23, 2, 4, 6, 7], k=6 Output: True Explanation: Because [2, 4] is a
continuous subarray of size 2 and sums up to 6.

[524] Longest Word in Dictionary through Deleting Medium
Given a string and a string dictionary, find the longest string in the
dictionary that can be formed by deleting some characters of the given
string. If there are more than one possible results, return the longest word
with the smallest lexicographical order. If there is no possible result,
return the empty string.

Input: s = "abpcplea", d = ["ale","apple","monkey","plea"]

[525] Contiguous Array Medium
Given a binary array, find the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with
equal number of 0 and 1.

with equal number of 0 and 1.

[526] Beautiful Arrangement Medium
Suppose you have N integers from 1 to N. We define a beautiful arrangement as
an array that is constructed by these N numbers successfully if one of the
following is true for the ith position (1 <= i <= N) in this array:
The number at the ith position is divisible by i. i is divisible by the
number at the ith position.
Now given N, how many beautiful arrangements can you construct?

Input: 2 Output: 2

restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to
ensure that a URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be
decoded to the original URL.

[541] Reverse String II Easy
Given a string and an integer k, you need to reverse the first k characters
for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string. If there are
less than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k
but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k
characters and left the other as original.

Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2 Output: "bacdfeg"

[543] Diameter of Binary Tree Easy
Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the
tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between
any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.
Example: Given a binary tree 1 / \ 2 3 / \ 4 5
Return 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].


[551] Student Attendance Record I Easy
You are given a string representing an attendance record for a student. The
record only contains the following three characters:
'A' : Absent. 'L' : Late. 'P' : Present.
A student could be rewarded if his attendance record doesn't contain more
than one 'A' (absent) or more than two continuous 'L' (late).
You need to return whether the student could be rewarded according to his
attendance record.

Input: "PPALLP" Output: True

(absent) or more than two continuous 'L' (late).

Input: n = 2 Output: 8 Explanation: There are 8 records with length 2 will be
regarded as rewardable: "PP" , "AP", "PA", "LP", "PL", "AL", "LA", "LL" Only
"AA" won't be regarded as rewardable owing to more than one absent times.

[554] Brick Wall Medium
There is a brick wall in front of you. The wall is rectangular and has
several rows of bricks. The bricks have the same height but different width.
You want to draw a vertical line from the top to the bottom and cross the
least bricks. The brick wall is represented by a list of rows. Each row is a
list of integers representing the width of each brick in this row from left
to right. If your line go through the edge of a brick, then the brick is not
considered as crossed. You need to find out how to draw the line to cross the
least bricks and return the number of crossed bricks. You cannot draw a line
just along one of the two vertical edges of the wall, in which case the line
will obviously cross no bricks.

order.

[587] Erect the Fence Hard
There are some trees, where each tree is represented by (x,y) coordinate in a
two-dimensional garden. Your job is to fence the entire garden using the
minimum length of rope as it is expensive. The garden is well fenced only if
all the trees are enclosed. Your task is to help find the coordinates of
trees which are exactly located on the fence perimeter.
All trees should be enclosed together. You cannot cut the rope to enclose
trees that will separate them in more than one group. All input integers will
range from 0 to 100. The garden has at least one tree. All coordinates are
distinct. Input points have NO order. No order required for output.

[606] Construct String from Binary Tree Easy
You need to construct a string consists of parenthesis and integers from a
binary tree with the preorder traversing way. The null node needs to be
represented by empty parenthesis pair "()". And you need to omit all the
empty parenthesis pairs that don't affect the one-to-one mapping relationship
between the string and the original binary tree.

Input: Binary tree: [1,2,3,4] 1 / \ 2 3 / 4
Output: "1(2(4))(3)" Explanation: Originallay it needs to be
"1(2(4)())(3()())", but you need to omit all the unnecessary empty
parenthesis pairs. And it will be "1(2(4))(3)".

[621] Task Scheduler Medium
Given a char array representing tasks CPU need to do. It contains capital
letters A to Z where different letters represent different tasks. Tasks could
be done without original order. Each task could be done in one interval. For
each interval, CPU could finish one task or just be idle. However, there is a
non-negative cooling interval n that means between two same tasks, there must
be at least n intervals that CPU are doing different tasks or just be idle.
You need to return the least number of intervals the CPU will take to finish
all the given tasks.

[636] Exclusive Time of Functions Medium
On a single threaded CPU, we execute some functions. Each function has a
unique id between 0 and N-1. We store logs in timestamp order that describe
when a function is entered or exited. Each log is a string with this format:
"{function_id}:{"start" | "end"}:{timestamp}". For example, "0:start:3" means
the function with id 0 started at the beginning of timestamp 3. "1:end:2"
means the function with id 1 ended at the end of timestamp 2. A function's
exclusive time is the number of units of time spent in this function. Note
that this does not include any recursive calls to child functions. Return the
exclusive time of each function, sorted by their function id.

There is a robot starting at position (0, 0), the origin, on a 2D plane.
Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot ends up at (0, 0) after it
completes its moves. The move sequence is represented by a string, and the
character moves[i] represents its ith move. Valid moves are R (right), L
(left), U (up), and D (down). If the robot returns to the origin after it
finishes all of its moves, return true. Otherwise, return false. Note: The
way that the robot is "facing" is irrelevant. "R" will always make the robot
move to the right once, "L" will always make it move left, etc. Also, assume
that the magnitude of the robot's movement is the same for each move.

[658] Find K Closest Elements Medium
Given a sorted array, two integers k and x, find the k closest elements to x

Input: [[1,2], [1,3], [2,3]] Output: [2,3] Explanation: The given undirected
graph will be like this: 1 / \ 2 - 3
Input: [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,4], [1,5]] Output: [1,4] Explanation: The
given undirected graph will be like this: 5 - 1 - 2 | | 4 - 3

[685] Redundant Connection II Hard
In this problem, a rooted tree is a directed graph such that, there is
exactly one node (the root) for which all other nodes are descendants of this
node, plus every node has exactly one parent, except for the root node which
has no parents. The given input is a directed graph that started as a rooted
tree with N nodes (with distinct values 1, 2, ..., N), with one additional
directed edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1
to N, and was not an edge that already existed. The resulting graph is given
as a 2D-array of edges. Each element of edges is a pair [u, v] that
represents a directed edge connecting nodes u and v, where u is a parent of
child v. Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a
rooted tree of N nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that
occurs last in the given 2D-array. Example 1:

Input: [[1,2], [1,3], [2,3]] Output: [2,3] Explanation: The given directed
graph will be like this: 1 / \ v v 2-->3

[686] Repeated String Match Easy
Given two strings A and B, find the minimum number of times A has to be
repeated such that B is a substring of it. If no such solution, return -1.
For example, with A = "abcd" and B = "cdabcdab". Return 3, because by
repeating A three times (“abcdabcdabcd”), B is a substring of it; and B is
not a substring of A repeated two times ("abcdabcd"). Note: The length of A
and B will be between 1 and 10000.

[687] Longest Univalue Path Easy
Given a binary tree, find the length of the longest path where each node in
the path has the same value. This path may or may not pass through the root.
The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges
between them.

Input: 5 / \ 4 5 / \ \ 1 1 5 Output: 2

[689] Maximum Sum of 3 Non-Overlapping Subarrays Hard
In a given array nums of positive integers, find three non-overlapping
subarrays with maximum sum.
Each subarray will be of size k, and we want to maximize the sum of all 3*k
entries.
Return the result as a list of indices representing the starting position of
each interval (0-indexed). If there are multiple answers, return the
lexicographically smallest one.

Example:

Input: [1,2,1,2,6,7,5,1], 2 Output: [0, 3, 5] Explanation: Subarrays [1, 2],
[2, 6], [7, 5] correspond to the starting indices [0, 3, 5]. We could have
also taken [2, 1], but an answer of [1, 3, 5] would be lexicographically
larger.

[696] Count Binary Substrings Easy
Give a string s, count the number of non-empty (contiguous) substrings that
have the same number of 0's and 1's, and all the 0's and all the 1's in these
substrings are grouped consecutively. Substrings that occur multiple times
are counted the number of times they occur.

Input: "00110011" Output: 6 Explanation: There are 6 substrings that have
equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's: "0011", "01", "1100", "10", "0011",
and "01". Notice that some of these substrings repeat and are counted the
number of times they occur. Also, "00110011" is not a valid substring because
all the 0's (and 1's) are not grouped together.

[714] Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee Medium
Your are given an array of integers prices, for which the i-th element is the
price of a given stock on day i; and a non-negative integer fee representing
a transaction fee. You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you
need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction. You may not buy more
than 1 share of a stock at a time (ie. you must sell the stock share before
you buy again.) Return the maximum profit you can make.

Input: prices = [1, 3, 2, 8, 4, 9], fee = 2 Output: 8 Explanation: The
maximum profit can be achieved by: Buying at prices[0] = 1Selling at
prices[3] = 8Buying at prices[4] = 4Selling at prices[5] = 9The total profit
is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.

[719] Find K-th Smallest Pair Distance Hard
Given an integer array, return the k-th smallest distance among all the
pairs. The distance of a pair (A, B) is defined as the absolute difference
between A and B.

Input: nums = [1,3,1] k = 1 Output: 0 Explanation: Here are all the pairs:
(1,3) -> 2 (1,1) -> 0 (3,1) -> 2 Then the 1st smallest distance pair is
(1,1), and its distance is 0.

[720] Longest Word in Dictionary Easy
Given a list of strings words representing an English Dictionary, find the
longest word in words that can be built one character at a time by other
words in words. If there is more than one possible answer, return the longest
word with the smallest lexicographical order. If there is no answer, return
the empty string.

Input: words = ["w","wo","wor","worl", "world"] Output: "world" Explanation:
The word "world" can be built one character at a time by "w", "wo", "wor",
and "worl".

[721] Accounts Merge Medium
Given a list accounts, each element accounts[i] is a list of strings, where
the first element accounts[i][0] is a name, and the rest of the elements are
emails representing emails of the account.

Now, we would like to merge these accounts. Two accounts definitely belong to
the same person if there is some email that is common to both accounts. Note
that even if two accounts have the same name, they may belong to different
people as people could have the same name. A person can have any number of
accounts initially, but all of their accounts definitely have the same name.

After merging the accounts, return the accounts in the following format: the
first element of each account is the name, and the rest of the elements are
emails in sorted order. The accounts themselves can be returned in any order.


[726] Number of Atoms Hard
Given a chemical formula (given as a string), return the count of each atom.
An atomic element always starts with an uppercase character, then zero or
more lowercase letters, representing the name.
1 or more digits representing the count of that element may follow if the
count is greater than 1. If the count is 1, no digits will follow. For
example, H2O and H2O2 are possible, but H1O2 is impossible.
Two formulas concatenated together produce another formula. For example,
H2O2He3Mg4 is also a formula.
A formula placed in parentheses, and a count (optionally added) is also a
formula. For example, (H2O2) and (H2O2)3 are formulas.
Given a formula, output the count of all elements as a string in the
following form: the first name (in sorted order), followed by its count (if
that count is more than 1), followed by the second name (in sorted order),
followed by its count (if that count is more than 1), and so on.

Input: formula = "H2O" Output: "H2O" Explanation: The count of elements are
{'H': 2, 'O': 1}.

[787] Cheapest Flights Within K Stops Medium
There are n cities connected by m flights. Each fight starts from city u and
arrives at v with a price w.
Now given all the cities and flights, together with starting city src and the
destination dst, your task is to find the cheapest price from src to dst with
up to k stops. If there is no such route, output -1.

Example 1: Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]] src = 0, dst
= 2, k = 1 Output: 200 Explanation: The graph looks like this:

[862] Shortest Subarray with Sum at Least K Hard
Return the length of the shortest, non-empty, contiguous subarray of A with
sum at least K. If there is no non-empty subarray with sum at least K, return
-1.

Input: A = [1], K = 1 Output: 1
