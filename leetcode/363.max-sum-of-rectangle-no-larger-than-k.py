# Testcase Example:  '[[1,0,1],[0,-2,3]]\n2'
#
# Given a non-empty 2D matrix matrix and an integer k, find the max sum of a
# rectangle in the matrix such that its sum is no larger than k.
#
# Example:
#
#
# Input: matrix = [[1,0,1],[0,-2,3]], k = 2
# Output: 2
# Explanation:Â Because the sum of rectangle [[0, 1], [-2, 3]] is
# 2,
# and 2 is the max number no larger than k (k = 2).
#
# Note:
#
#
# The rectangle inside the matrix must have an area > 0.
# What if the number of rows is much larger than the number of columns?
#
#
# Idea:
#  Reduce to (variant of) kadane
#
#  Reminder: Kadane = find subarray with larger sum
#
# First, we select the border lines of the rectangles O(n^2)
# Then we compute the sum for each column (using prefix sum, O(p))
# Last step is to find the largest sum larger than K
#
# The last step could be a hard problem on its own
#
# Find the larget sum no larger than K of a subarray
#
# See 1074 (same problem with different 1-D problem)
