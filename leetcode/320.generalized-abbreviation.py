# Testcase Example:  '"word"'
#
# Write a function to generate the generalized abbreviations of a word.
#
# Note:Â The order of the output does not matter.
#
# Example:
#
# Input: "word"
# Output:
# ["word", "1ord", "w1rd", "wo1d", "wor1", "2rd", "w2d", "wo2", "1o1d", "1or1",
# "w1r1", "1o2", "2r1", "3d", "w3", "4"]
