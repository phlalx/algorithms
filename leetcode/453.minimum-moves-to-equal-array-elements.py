# Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3]'
#
# Given a non-empty integer array of size n, find the minimum number of moves
# required to make all array elements equal, where a move is incrementing n - 1
# elements by 1.
# 
# Example:
# 
# Input:
# [1,2,3]
# 
# Output:
# 3
# 
# Explanation:
# Only three moves are needed (remember each move increments two elements):
# 
# [1,2,3]  =>  [2,3,3]  =>  [3,4,3]  =>  [4,4,4]
# 
#

class Solution:
    def minMoves(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        m = min(nums)
        return sum(u - m for u in nums)
