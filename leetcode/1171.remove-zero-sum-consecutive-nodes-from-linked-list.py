#
# Given the head of a linked list, we repeatedly delete consecutive sequences
# of nodes that sum to 0 until there are no such sequences.
#
# After doing so, return the head of the final linked list.Â  You may return any
# such answer.
#
#
# (Note that in the examples below, all sequences are serializations of
# ListNode objects.)
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: head = [1,2,-3,3,1]
# Output: [3,1]
# Note: The answer [1,2,1] would also be accepted.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: head = [1,2,3,-3,4]
# Output: [1,2,4]
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: head = [1,2,3,-3,-2]
# Output: [1]
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# The given linked list will contain between 1 and 1000 nodes.
# Each node in the linked list has -1000 <= node.val <= 1000.
#
#
#

# @lc code=start
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None
#
# Examples:
#   1 -> 1 -> -1 -> 3 -> None
#   0 -> None
#   1 -> -1 -> None
#   2 -> 1 -> -1 -> -2 -> None
#
#
#   1 -> 1 -> 2 -> -2 -> -1 -> 3 -> None
#      s = 3                  s = 3
#
# TAGS cool 2-sum linked list
# good application of OrderedDict, even though there must be a different
# solution
