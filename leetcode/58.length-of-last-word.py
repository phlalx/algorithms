# Testcase Example:  '"Hello World"'
#
# Given a string s consists of upper/lower-case alphabets and empty space
# characters ' ', return the length of last word (last word means the last
# appearing word if we loop from left to right) in the string.
# 
# If the last word does not exist, return 0.
# 
# Note: A word is defined as a maximal substring consistingÂ of non-space
# characters only.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input: "Hello World"
# Output: 5
