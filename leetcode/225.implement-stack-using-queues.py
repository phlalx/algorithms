#
# Implement the following operations of a stack using queues.
#
#
# push(x) -- Push element x onto stack.
# pop() -- Removes the element on top of the stack.
# top() -- Get the top element.
# empty() -- Return whether the stack is empty.
#
#
# Example:
#
#
# MyStack stack = new MyStack();
#
# stack.push(1);
# stack.push(2);
# stack.top();   // returns 2
# stack.pop();   // returns 2
# stack.empty(); // returns false
#
# Notes:
#
#
# You must use only standard operations of a queue -- which means only push to
# back, peek/pop from front, size, and is empty operations are valid.
# Depending on your language, queue may not be supported natively. You may
# simulate a queue by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as
# you use only standard operations of a queue.
# You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or top
# operations will be called on an empty stack).
#
#
#

# Not as fun as its dual problem. Reverse the queue for
# each push operation
