#
# Given a set of intervals, for each of the interval i, check if there exists
# an interval j whose start point is bigger than or equal to the end point of
# the interval i, which can be called that j is on the "right" of i.
#
# For any interval i, you need to store the minimum interval j's index, which
# means that the interval j has the minimum start point to build the "right"
# relationship for interval i. If the interval j doesn't exist, store -1 for
# the interval i. Finally, you need output the stored value of each interval as
# an array.
#
# Note:
#
#
# You may assume the interval's end point is always bigger than its start
# point.
# You may assume none of these intervals have the same start point.
#
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: [ [1,2] ]
#
# Output: [-1]
#
# Explanation: There is only one interval in the collection, so it outputs
# -1.
#
#
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: [ [3,4], [2,3], [1,2] ]
#
# Output: [-1, 0, 1]
#
# Explanation: There is no satisfied "right" interval for [3,4].
# For [2,3], the interval [3,4] has minimum-"right" start point;
# For [1,2], the interval [2,3] has minimum-"right" start point.
#
#
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: [ [1,4], [2,3], [3,4] ]
#
# Output: [-1, 2, -1]
#
# Explanation: There is no satisfied "right" interval for [1,4] and [3,4].
# For [2,3], the interval [3,4] has minimum-"right" start point.
