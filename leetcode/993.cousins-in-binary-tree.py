#
# In a binary tree, the root node is at depth 0, and children of each depth k
# node are at depth k+1.
# 
# Two nodes of a binary tree are cousins if they have the same depth, but have
# different parents.
# 
# We are given the root of a binary tree with unique values, and the values x
# and y of two different nodes in the tree.
# 
# Return true if and only if the nodes corresponding to the values x and y are
# cousins.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# 
# Input: root = [1,2,3,4], x = 4, y = 3
# Output: false
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# 
# Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4,null,5], x = 5, y = 4
# Output: true
# 
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4], x = 2, y = 3
# Output: false
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in the tree will be between 2 and 100.
# Each node has a unique integer value from 1 to 100.
