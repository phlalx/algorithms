#
# A string of '0's and '1's is monotone increasing if it consists of some
# number of '0's (possibly 0), followed by some number of '1's (also possibly
# 0.)
#
# We are given a string S of '0's and '1's, and we may flip any '0' to a '1' or
# a '1' to a '0'.
#
# Return the minimum number of flips to make S monotone increasing.
#
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: "00110"
# Output: 1
# Explanation: We flip the last digit to get 00111.
#
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: "010110"
# Output: 2
# Explanation: We flip to get 011111, or alternatively 000111.
#
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: "00011000"
# Output: 2
# Explanation: We flip to get 00000000.
#
#
#
#
# Note:
#
#
# 1 <= S.length <= 20000
# S only consists of '0' and '1' characters.
