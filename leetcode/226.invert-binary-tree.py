# Trivia:
# This problem was inspired by this original tweet by Max Howell:
#
# Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you
# can’t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so f*** off.
#
#

# @lc code=start
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def invertTree(self, root: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        def f(t):
            if t is None:
                return t
            res = TreeNode(t.val)
            res.left = f(t.right)
            res.right = f(t.left)
            return res
        return f(root)
